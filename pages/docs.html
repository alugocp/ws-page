		<h1>Routing <img class="ball" src="images/thunder-right.png"></img></h1>
		<p>
			One of WebStatic's two main features is page routing.
			Routing is how a website (usually a dynamic server-powered one) determines which content to show based on your input url.
			For example, test.com will give you a different page than test.com/info.
			WebStatic makes routing easy, although being a static framework it is limited in its flexibility.
			If you have some WebStatic site called test.com, then your pages/index.html file is what will load when you open the site.
			Any other file in the pages folder (say, pages/info.html) will be accessible as a subroute to the main page, so test.com/info as in our example.
		</p>
		<p>
			Providing links from one page to another in WebStatic is simple.
			Just provide relative paths from routed URLs.
			For example, to link from pages/index.html to pages/info.html, use an a tag with href attribute of info.
			For the other way around set your href attribute to "../".

		<h1>Scripts and styles <img class="ball" src="images/thunder-right.png"></img></h1>
		<p>
			WebStatic is designed to work with raw JavaScript and CSS files, there's no new languages you have to learn.
			To include a JS or CSS file in any of your pages or components, simply use a script or link tag respectively (as you would in an ordinary website).
			If the file you want to include is a child of the scripts or styles folders, you can skip that part of the filepath.
			For example, scripts/hello.js can be included via a script tag with a src attribute of hello.js.
			The styles folder works the same way for CSS files (by convention).
			Any other folders (or files in the root directory of your project) can be included via a filepath from the project's root directory.

		<h1>Components <img class="ball" src="images/thunder-right.png"></img></h1>
		<p>
			Components are WebStatic's second main feature, and it's found in many other JavaScript frameworks including Angular.
			A component is a blokc of HTML, CSS and JS code (like object-oriented HTML or a "widget") that you can insert into multiple pages on your site.
			To create a component, simply add a new html file into your components folder.
			The name of your file will be the component name.
			Your component file doesn't need any html, body or head tags, just place in the content directly.
			You can also add script and style tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any JS or CSS you write in the component will be automatically scoped to that component (CSS rules will get ".component.<i>component name</i>" placed in front of them).
			CSS selectors in jQuery calls will also get scoped to the component.
			If you would like to select the entire component with CSS/jQuery, simply use .<i>component name</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add a component to one of your pages, create a div or other container element and give it the component class and a class matching your component name.
			For example, if I wanted to add a component from my components/nav-bar.html file into a page, I would create a div with class of "component nav-bar".
			Webstatic will then scope your component code and copy/paste it into your container element.
